AER8375 Analyse et performance des avions

How to use:
For TP1C, run program TP1C_Hugo or TP1C_Ced. This program imports and utilise atmos.py and velocities.py.

For TP3C, run program TP3C (present in the TP3 folder). This program imports and utilise atmos.py, velocities.py, aircraft.py and
climb_descent.py.

For TP4C, run program TP4C (present in the TP4 folder). This program imports and utilise atmos.py, velocities.py, aircraft.py and
climb_descent.py.

atmos.py:
Contains function that allows us to model the atmosphere and therefore obtain different parameters from
a set of input that depends on the users need.

velocities.py:
Contains function that allows us to convert and calculate the speeds of the aircraft. Once again, inputs
are based on users need.

aircraft.py:
Class, containing attributes of the aircraft given in donn√©es avion. This class also contains function to calculate
coefficients, forces, NZ, etc. This class help us define the aircraft and the force applied to it. TP3 added functions to calculate a full mission for the aircraft. TP4 added functions to calculate takeoff speed and takeoff distances.

climb_descent.py :
Contains function needed to define climb and descent parameters from a set of input that depends on the users need.

The end.
Thank you.
