AER8375 Analyse et performance des avions

How to use:
For TP1C, run program TP1C_Hugo. This program imports and utilise atmos.py and velocities.py.

TP1A:
atmos.py contains function that allows us to model the atmosphere and therefore obtain different parameters from
a set of input that depends on the users need.

TP1B:
velocities.py contains function that allows us to convert and calculate the speeds of the aircraft. Once again, inputs
are based on users need.

The end. 
Thank you.
